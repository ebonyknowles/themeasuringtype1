My name is Ebony Knowles and for the last three years I have become an activist for change in regards to what can only be described as a global diet culture. By championing body positivity and dissecting the manipulation of corporations, I am trying my hardest to dismantle the hold the multi-billion pound diet industry has on the physical and mental wellbeing of the public.

I have decided to create this blog to dissect the way the diet industry uses typography, specifically how their use of colour, font and text, elevates their brands and convinces people into buying their products or services. I will be looking at the subtle manipulation tactics used by these corporations and how their design choices affect their customers' way of thinking, either intentionally or unintentionally.

By looking at how corporations such as *WeightWatchers*, *Slimming World* and *XLS Medical* have elevated their brand through text, with their recognisable logos and typography, I will examine what it is about their presentation that has the public so transfixed. In addition, I will also be looking at diet products aimed at the younger generation, and how their aesthetically pleasing advertisements and use of colour have helped them relate to their target audience.
